Why we need constructor  in Angular component class?

In Angular, a constructor is added to a TypeScript class primarily for dependency injection and if any initialization needs to carried
before angular life cycle events 

1.Dependency Injection
2.Initialization & any configuration 

Angular life cycle hooks
----------------------
Angular, lifecycle hooks are methods that allow you to tap into the lifecycle of a component or directive. These hooks provide points in the component's or directive's lifecycle where you can perform actions or execute code. This enables you to manage the behavior of your application at different stages


Note
public and private are access modifiers that define the visibility of class members (properties and methods).


Public 

When a member (property or method) is marked as public, it means that it can be accessed from outside the class. This includes accessing it from other classes, instances of the class, or anywhere else in your code.


class Example{
    public x;

    constructor(x){
        this.x= x
    }


    public doSomething(){
       console.log(this.x)
    }
}

const instance1 = new Example(42);
console.log(instance1.x)


2. Private 

When a member is marked as private, it means that it can only be accessed within the class where it is defined. It is not accessible from outside the class

class Example{
    private x;

    constructor(x){
        this.x= x
    }


    public doSomething1(){
       console.log(this.x)
    }

     private doSomething2(){
       console.log(this.x)
    }
}

const instance1 = new Example(42);
console.log(instance1.x)  //Error x is private and cannot be accessed from outside the class

instance.doSomething2() //ERror doSomething2 private and cannot be accessed from outside the class


public and private access modifiers are important for defining the visibility of class members within components, services, directives

privateProperty cannot be accessed directly in the template.
